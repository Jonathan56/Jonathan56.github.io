##The V2G-Sim project
![V2G-Sim]({{ site.url }}/assets/image/v2g.jpg)
*The Vehicle to grid simulator* has been developped to assess electrical vehicles (EVs) impact on the grid. 
V2G-Sim provides *bottom up modeling* from individual vehicle dynamics all the way up to aggregate grid impacts and opportunities. It's an *open source Python software* available on [Github](#). For more details feel free to read the [user manual](#), or consult existing publications.
My Work in the project consisted in implemeting:

	- the existing MATLAB code in Python
	- an user interface in Python
	- new itinerary generation
	- new charging controllers (based on renewable energy production)
	- battery degradation
	- ...

##The MyGreenCar project
![MyGreenCar]({{ site.url }}/assets/image/mygreencar.png)
MyGreenCar seeks to increase *the adoption of clean vehicles* by enabling drivers and fleet managers to understand whether clean vehicles *meet their personal needs*, and quantify the magnitude of *fuel and cost savings* from choosing a clean vehicle.
MyGreenCar is a *free* Android/Iphone/Web application available for download at [www.mygreencar-01.com](www.mygreencar-01.com).
My work in the project has been focused on the server side:

	- database structure
	- web development with Django
	- IU/IX development with D3.js
	- vehicle simulation in Python
