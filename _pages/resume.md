## 2) Education
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/UTC_logo.png" alt="UTC logo" width="350">
I have done most of my studies at the [*Technical University of Compiegne*](https://www.utc.fr/en.html) (2010-2015), a French top ranking engineering institution. I have obtained my degree from the civil engineering department, but I have equaly shared my time with the electrical department. Here is my [transcript]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/transcript.pdf).

The most influent lecture I had during my studies were «&nbsp;*Renewable energy conversion and management*&nbsp;» «&nbsp;*Power electronics*&nbsp;» «&nbsp;*Electrical machines*&nbsp;» and «&nbsp;Urban management&nbsp;». The design of a small scale wind turbine controller has been one of my biggest academic project ([short report]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/Tx_Small_scale_wind_turbine.pdf)).

Through my work at the UTC I obtained recommandation letters from: [Fabrice Locment and Manuela Sechilariu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/1_recommendation_FL.pdf), [Phillipe Sergent]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/2_recommendation_CEREMA.pdf) and [Vincent Lanfranchi]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/3_recommendation_VL.pdf).

I have also spent a semester of study abroad in Riga (Latvia). Here is a [transcript]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/transcript_Riga.jpg) of my semester.

## 3) Work experiences

[The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](http://www.lbl.gov/) from 2015 to nowadays, my work is focused on vehicle to grid interactions, and grid reliability.

[The CEREMA](http://www.cerema.fr/) (Centre For Studies and Expertise on Risks, Environment, Mobility, and Urban and Country planning). I studied the best emplacement to harvest wave's energy at the shore in [Audierne's bay](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Esquibien,+France/@48.019122,-4.6068608,1225z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x4816e058cded9379:0x40ca5cd36e56db0). The project involved the use of [SWASH](http://swash.sourceforge.net/) to provide a general basis for describing wave transformations from deep water to a beach, port or harbour. [The study (final report in French)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/internship_CEREMA.pdf) also includes a cost analysis for different devices.
